# Irene's React Native coding challenge

Hi Rafal, here's my code solution to the challenge.

## Brief

I ran in a couple issues with running an emulator on the current laptop I'm using (it's ooold). However, I did manage to run my code in an Expo project and just copy-paste into this project. Expo allowed me to run an emulator in my browser and test on a variety of devices.

I pushed directly to `master` because it's just me here so feel free to check out my chunk of changes. 

I'm not sure why but, in the fonts you included, the weights didn't differentiate from "bold" to "medium" to "light"--so I just used the `fontWeight` property to modify to match the designs.

Here are some screenshots of my final product on iPhone SE:
